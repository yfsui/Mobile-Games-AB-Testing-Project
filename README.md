# Mobile Games: AB Testing & Player Retention

This project is based on a mini project from <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184">Datacamp</a>.

## Introduction

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cookiecatsgame">Cookie Cats</a> is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by <a href="http://tactile.dk">Tactile Entertainment</a>. It's a classic "connect three"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. Check out this short demo: https://youtu.be/GaP5f0jVTWE.

As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress.

***The main objective of project is to analyze an A/B test and determine if the gate should be moved from level 30 to level 40.***

## Data Source
The dataset is publicly available on Datacamp, which can be retrieved from https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184.
